# What is Smartspendee?

*WIP* Smartspendee is a mini project of mine to keep myself accountable with my spending habits and also keep me motivated in learning more about software development.

I started off with creating a terminal program using python and pandas. I realised that it would be better if I could implement this code into a web app, hence I used flask as my framework to make this happen. I also made use of HTML and CSS to create static web pages for viewing while maintaining the same user functions.

Smartspendee allows users to add their monthly income/allowance, add or edit their expenses, and also view said expenses with pie chart statistics. I utilised matplotlib and pandas to create the statistics page.

## Tech stack I used

python, flask, html, css

## Things to note

Made use of a relatively simple tech stack to achieve same user functions as I originally did in the terminal based program/CLI.

File directory was made in a way for greater scalability in earlier development stages.
