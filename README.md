*WIP* spendee is a mini project of mine to keep myself accountable with my spending habits and also keep me motivated in learning more about software development.

I started off with creating a terminal program using python and pandas. I realised that it would be better if I could implement this code into a web app, hence I used flask as my framework to make this happen. I also made use of HTML and CSS to create static web pages for viewing while maintaining the same user functions.

python, flask, html, css
